  <h1>Subclassing UIViewController</h1>
  <p>
    A given screen in an iOS application is actually a hierarchy of
    views.  While individual buttons and labels are views, they are all
    children of the screen wide view. This is the view that is presented
    by the view controller. To add an interface to this basic
    application, lets create a new view controller. From XCode, create a
    new file, then choose Cocoa Touch Objective-C class.

    On the next screen you will have an option to choose to make our
    new class a subclass of a Framework class. Choose to subclass
    UIViewController. When you do this there will be a checkbox
    to also create a XIB file. Select this checkbox.

    This creates three new files, a header and implementation
    for the class, and the XIB.

  <h1>What's a XIB?</h1>
  <p>
    XIB files let you visually create a user interface. They
    contain a hierarchy of views and information about how
    their targets connect to each other. A XIB can represent
    multiple scenes, a small subcomponent of a scene, however
    conventionally there is usually a 1:1 between XIB file
    and a view controller. When you select the XIB file from
    the Project Navigator in XCode, the interface changes.

    At this point we need to bring out the Utilities pane from
    the right side of the editor. This is where you can create
    new UI components and edit their properties.
