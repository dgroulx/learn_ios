  It's hard to play with types without the ability to print them
  to the console, but in order to do so, we need to understand
  format strings. Back in the Hello World!  program, we used NSLog
  to print out a fixed string:
</p>
<code>NSLog(@"Hello World!");</code>

<p>
  But now we want to print out variables as well. Unfortunately,
  we need to tell NSLog the type of the variable as well. Each
  type has an associated token of the form <code>%&lt;x&gt;</code>
  where <code>x</code> is determined by the type of the variable.

<dl>
  <dt>Integers</dt>
  <dd>%i</dd>
  <dt>Decimals (floats)</dt>
  <dd>%f</dd>
  <dt>NSString</dt>
  <dd>%@</dd>
</dl>

<pre>
NSString *name = @"Imp";
float height = 3.43;
int age = 4000;
NSLog(@"I saw a %@ that was %f feet tall and %d years old", name, height, age);
</pre>

<p>
  Note that the variables appear in the order they are referenced
  in the format string.
