    <h1>A Summary of C</h1>

    <h2>Types</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>
	<code>
	  short, int, long, NSInteger
	</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
	Represent integers. <code>short</code> holds smaller numbers
	than <code>int</code>, which is smaller
	than <code>long</code>. <code>NSInteger</code> is a type
	provided by Apple that is an integer of the ideal size for the
	current platform, be it iOS or OS X.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>float, double, CGFloat</code></dt>
      <dd>
	Decimal numbers, <code>double</code> is capable of storing
	higher precision numbers than <code>float</code>, but uses up
	double the storage space. CGFloat is the decimal type used by
	the iOS Core Graphics framework.
      </dd>
      <dt>Pointer</dt>
      <dd>
	Pointers are variables that "point" to other variables. In
	Objective-C, we never deal with objects directly, but instead
	pass around pointers to them. This is why when we declare an
	object, the variable that we store is a pointer to the object.<br>
	<code>NSDate *today = [NSDate date];</code><br>
        Technically we say that "today is a pointer to an NSDate,"
        however since objects are always stored as pointers, normally
        you will just say that "today is an NSDate."
      </dd>
      <dt><code>struct</code></dt>
      <dd>
	Structures are composite types. They allow us to group together data
	into a more complicated concept. For example I want a type Location
	that knows the name, latitude, and longitude of a location and the number
	of times I had visited that place.
	<pre>
typedef struct {
  float latitude;
  float longitude;
  int visits;
} Location;
	</pre>
	Elements of a struct are accessed using dot notation.
	<pre>
Location theFactory;
theFactory.latitude = 42.963107; 
theFactory.longitude = -85.669407;
theFactory.visits = 42;
	</pre>
	Structs are used frequently in iOS development. Try looking up NSRect
	in the XCode documentation.  NSRects are used to represent the
	location of a user interface element
