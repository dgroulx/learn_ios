    <h1>Importing Libraries</h1>

    <p>
      Libraries in C are split into two files, the interface, or
      header file (.h) and implementation (.m).  The header tells the
      user what functionality is provided by the library. The
      implementation has the actual code. In this way it is easy to
      provide users with the interface files, and then give them a
      binary version of the library such that you can keep the
      implementation private.
    </p>

    <h2>Frameworks</h2>
    
    <p>
      Frameworks are a concept unique to OS X and iOS. Frameworks are
      folders that group together headers, binaries, and documentation
      for easy distribution. To see the various frameworks on your
      system, open <code>/System/Library/Frameworks</code> from the Finder. Despite
      looking like little legos, these are really just folders that
      you can double click on and look inside. In the Hello World
      program, we imported the Fondation framework with the line<br>
      <code>@import Foundation;</code>
    </p>

    <h2>System Libraries</h2>

    <p>
      System libraries are functionality that is outside of the C
      language defintion but are considered part of the standard
      language library. While much of the functionality of the C
      standard library will be superceeded by iOS frameworks, we
      do occasionally need to use the C standard librarys, for
      example the math library.<br>
      <code>#import &lt;math.h&gt;</code><br>
      Commands that start with the '#' character are known as
      preprocessor directives. There are many of these, but
      <code>#import</code> is the most common one we will use. The
      angle brackets are what specify that this is a system library.
    </p>

    <h2>Custom Libraries</h2>
    
    <p>
      Custom libraries are code that we develop and want to reuse. They
      are included almost identically to ystem libraries:<br>
      <code>#import "console.h"</code><br>
      Note the quotation marks. This means that the compiler will look for
      <code>console.h</code> in local paths.
