    <h1>Loops</h1>

    <p>
      Computers were invented to perform repetative tasks, so we need
      tools to make performing the same action over and over again
      easy.  There are two main looping constructs for this task:
      while and for loops.
    </p>

    <h2>While</h2>

    <p>
      <code>while</code> loops are useful when the loop will be performed an unknown
      number of times, instead terminating when some condition is met.
    </p>      
    <pre>
while (condition) {
  // Perform this task until condition is false
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      It is important to make sure that the body of the loop will eventually
      cause the condition to be false, otherwise your program can run forever.
    </p>

    <h2>For</h2>
    
    <p>
      <code>for</code> loops are used when a block of code should be
      run a known number of times, or the block of code needs access
      to the iteration variable.
    </p>
    <pre>
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
  // Perform this as long as i is less than 10
}
    </pre>

    <p>
      We have access to the counting variable inside of the loop. This can be
      used, for example, to print out the numbers between 1 and 10.
    </p>
    <pre>
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
  NSLog(@"The number is: %d", i);
}
   </pre>
